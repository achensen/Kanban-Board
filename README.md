## Additional Notes 
 The initial code for this project was provided by EDX Engineering Services Company to complete an assignment for a Full Stack Web Development Course. My contribution was to complete the code to ensure it had full functionality similar to the mock up that was provided. I did receive tutoring assistance to help with my understanding of this assignment, specifically with setting up middleware.
